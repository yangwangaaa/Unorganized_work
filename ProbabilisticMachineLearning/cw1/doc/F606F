Completeness, quantity of content
All the questions have been answered. For questions a) and b), a discussion of the hyper-parameters and and the difference between the models are missing.

Correctness, quality of content
The experiments were carried out correctly. Good analysis of question c. Note that the additive model in question e is actually a simpler model, and therefore the complexity term is lower (i.e. better) while the data fits are in fact almost the same for both models.

Depth of understanding, quality of discussion
In general, the student has a good understanding of the topic.

Overall assessment:
B+
